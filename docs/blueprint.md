# **App Name**: NephroSim

## Core Features:

- Scenario Generation: Presents users with realistic case scenarios involving kidney disease, including patient history and initial conditions.
- Clinical Parameters Display: A panel to display the patient's clinical parameters (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate) in real-time.
- Laboratory Parameters Display: A panel to display laboratory results (e.g., creatinine, electrolytes) and track their changes over time.
- Intervention Selection: A dropdown list of available interventions (medications, procedures) that can be selected to treat the patient.
- Real-time Clock: A timer that visually represents the limited time available (5 minutes) to manage the patient's condition.
- Condition Modeling: Each intervention will affect clinical and laboratory parameters and lead to improved or worsened condition over time.
- Budget Tracking: Tracks available budget and intervention cost

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust, expertise, and seriousness in medical simulations.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop for the simulation data.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) for highlighting key interventions or critical parameters that need immediate attention; chosen for its association with health.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its readability and clean design.
- Use clear and professional icons to represent medical interventions and parameters.
- Divide the screen into distinct panels for patient data, interventions, and a real-time clock for easy navigation.
- Use subtle animations to provide visual feedback on the impact of medical interventions, reinforcing the cause-and-effect relationship.
